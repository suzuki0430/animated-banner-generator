# 🏞️ Animated Banner Generator with Amazon Nova Reel + Gradio

## 🔐 Notes on AWS Integration

To use Amazon Bedrock (Nova Reel) and S3 upload, this app requires the following environment variables to be set as **Hugging Face Secrets**:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION` (e.g. `ap-northeast-1`)

If Bedrock fails or is unavailable, a fallback demo video is used.

## 🖼️ Example Prompts

- `"A seamless loop of glowing neon lights forming a tunnel in a futuristic cyberpunk city"`
